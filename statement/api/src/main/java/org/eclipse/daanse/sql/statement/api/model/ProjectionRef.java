/**
 * A stable handle to a projection returned by the assembler when an expression is added to
 * the {@code SELECT} list.
 * <p>
 * Callers pass this handle to {@code groupOn}/{@code orderOn} instead of re-deriving an
 * alias string. The renderer resolves the handle's {@link #ordinal()} to the effective
 * alias (or back to the expression) per the dialect's capabilities at render time — which
 * is what removes the alias-return coupling of the old builder.
 *
 * @param ordinal       zero-based position of the projection in the {@code SELECT} list
 * @param explicitAlias the alias requested by the caller, if any (else the renderer may
 *                      auto-generate one when the dialect allows column aliases)
